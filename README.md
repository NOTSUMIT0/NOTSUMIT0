## About Me

I am a third-year undergraduate student from India focused on software development and full-stack web applications.  
I enjoy building real projects that demonstrate problem solving, clean architecture, and practical use cases.  
On GitHub, I share my coding journey, experiment with new ideas, and build solutions that help me learn and grow as a developer.

My primary areas of focus include:
- Full-stack web development using Python, Flask, and traditional web technologies
- Backend logic, API design, and database integration
- UI/UX structure and front-end fundamentals
- Exploring blockchain basics and dynamic system concepts
