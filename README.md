## About Me

I am a third-year undergraduate **B.Tech (CSE)** student from India with hands-on experience in software development and full-stack web applications. I focus on building practical, real-world projects that strengthen my understanding of backend systems, web architecture, and user-facing applications.

My approach to learning is project-driven. I enjoy breaking down complex problems, writing clean code, and continuously improving through experimentation and collaboration.

My primary interests include:
- Full-stack web development using Python and Flask 
- Backend logic, APIs, and database design
- Backend architecture and role-based workflows
- Building deployable, portfolio-grade products
