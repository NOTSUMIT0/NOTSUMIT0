## About Me

I am a motivated and curious developer who enjoys working across different areas of software development.  
My primary interests include full-stack web development, backend systems, and exploring modern technologies through real-world projects.

I believe in writing clean, understandable code and learning concepts deeply rather than just using tools at a surface level. GitHub is where I document my learning journey and showcase my work.
